Objective: This app is the framework for a social media API. Users can create, view, delete and update 
thoughts and reactions. A user is also able to add other users as friends and react to other user's posted 
thoughts. 

What I Learned: How to build NoSQL databases with MongoDB. I also recieved a great deal of practice setting up routers
and controllers. I look forward to recieving a lot more needed practice with Mongo in the near future.
